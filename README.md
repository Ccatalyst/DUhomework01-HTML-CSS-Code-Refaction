## Refaction

- Removed redundant code by consolidating classes with exact styles into a singular class
- Fixed navigation bar links to properly navigate to proper parts of the page
- Added class to main container with CSS to properly move aside container to the right of the main container
- Fixed CSS on aside images to be centered in the container
- Removed class from footer and changed visibility to hidden, so it will still show up in searches, but isn't seen on the page
- Added comments to css file, describing changes and intentions to tags.
